LeeDo Manifesto

On a “Living Language” in the Age of AI

LeeDo Manifesto

Human language has become fragmented and divided,
preventing great ideas from fully reaching one another.
As a result, countless people—despite holding innovative thoughts—are frequently blocked by the barriers of complex coding and cumbersome distribution processes, ultimately failing to bring their ideas into the world.
Moved by this disconnection in communication and the suppression of creativity,
I create a new public sphere called LeeDo (LEEDO)—
a space where anyone can immediately shape their thoughts into functional tools.

The purpose of LeeDo is singular.
It is to enable everyone to easily learn this new language, to transform their ideas into living applications on a daily basis, and to share and use them without downloads thereby making life richer and more convenient.

LeeDo (이도)— derived from 利 (benefit) and 道 (path)
means a language that guides the world toward a beneficial path.
The name LeeDo expresses respect for King Sejong, the creator of Hangul, and reflects the intention to inherit his spirit by creating a new language for a new era.
Global Slogan
Don’t just say it, LeeDo it.

Motivation

Visual media began as the exclusive domain of large capital through television,
but with the emergence of YouTube, the public ceased to be mere consumers and became creators.
As of January 2026, coding is undergoing a similar shift. With the rise of AI and vibe coding, the perception of coding as “an expert-only domain” is rapidly weakening.
This change naturally demands the following transitions:
● People can no longer remain passive downloaders of apps from app stores.
● Users must be able to produce and share applications based on their own ideas.
● Applications created by others must be instantly experienceable.
● Above all, innovation emerges the moment the concept of “download” disappears.


LeeDo envisions a space similar to Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts—
where users upload simple, idea-driven applications into a feed,
others instantly run them, and through remixing and feedback, these creations evolve.
Fun and utility are not dictated by the platform. They emerge organically through users’ experiments and interactions.


1. Context of the Era
The current app ecosystem is centered around app stores and Google Play,
with production led by a limited group of developers.
However, as AI dramatically reduces production costs,
this structure becomes not a matter of capability but a bottleneck of distribution—
one that can no longer keep pace with the times.
In an era where individual ideas can be endlessly produced,
a new space where those ideas can be distributed, experienced, and evolved becomes inevitable.
LeeDo is the first proposal to structurally address that inevitability.

2. Definition of LeeDo
A New Public Sphere and a New Language System for the AI Era

LeeDo is not merely a software repository.
It is a new form of public sphere born through AI as its medium.

3. Inheriting the Core Values of the Public Sphere
LeeDo adopts the values defined by Jürgen Habermas as the foundation of a new society.

● Universal Access: Breaking down capital and technical barriers so that anyone can turn their ideas into software.
● Equality: Within this new society, corporate applications and personal creations are evaluated solely by the value of their ideas and their practical utility. The creator’s background is irrelevant.
● Rational Interaction: Moving beyond passive consumption, users remix, critique, and refine one another’s creations through feedback, forming collective intelligence.



4. “Sharing Without Installation, Making Creation Everyday”

The traditional model—where applications are consumed only after store registration and downloads—fails to reflect the speed of modern society.
While vibe coding democratizes development,
society still lacks a platform that truly accommodates this shift.
LeeDo emerges as a new concept that directly addresses this gap.


5. The Ideal Functions of LeeDo
● Anyone can immediately turn an idea into an executable form.
● Results are shared and experienced naturally, without downloads.
● Value transmission is not monopolized by specific groups.
● Anyone can create, share, and instantly experience others’ creations.
● Individual outputs inspire others, while feedback fuels further growth.
Through this cycle, LeeDo becomes not a static collection of products,
but an evolving creative ecosystem and a living public sphere of expression.

6. Summary of LeeDo

Ultimately, LeeDo transcends the traditional public square of words and text,
becoming an evolved public sphere of the AI era—
where people communicate and solve problems through functions and tools.
Here, humanity translates thoughts into living applications
and converses with the world through them.

7. Societal Impact
The Physical Evolution of Language and the Fusion of Intelligence

LeeDo represents not merely the emergence of a platform, but a paradigm shift in the very structure of language that underpins human civilization.

1) The Collapse of Language Barriers: From Explanation to Simulation
Historically, humanity relied on language—an inherently imperfect medium—to convey knowledge.

Though barriers lowered from text to video, interpretation and translation remained constraints. Within LeeDo, knowledge is no longer read or heard.
A user can say, “Create a 3D animated app that shows how to cook spaghetti,”
and through vibe coding, knowledge transforms into an immediately executable experience. Language ceases to be something to interpret.
It becomes an environment to inhabit.

2) The Physicalization of Language
In the LeeDo era, language is no longer sound in the air or text on paper.
It becomes a physical, active entity experienced through sight, sound, and touch.

The moment a desire is expressed, LeeDo shapes it into a functioning application—a tool. Thus, humanity gains the ability to instantly convert abstract thought into real-world instruments.

3) The Fusion of Intelligence and Language: A New Mode of Human Communication
LeeDo is a vast experimental field where human intent (language) merges with AI’s execution (intelligence).
We no longer strive to explain our thoughts.
Instead, we hand others intelligent, functioning tools imbued with our intent.
This marks an unprecedented form of communication—
where humanity’s primal intuition for tool-making converges with artificial superintelligence




8. Future Outlook
The Wearable Era and the Inevitability of LeeDo

The End of Smartphones and the Beginning of Transparent Communication
As smartphones fade and wearable devices such as smart glasses become the primary interface, LeeDo evolves beyond a platform into a Sensory Operating System that expands human perception.

1) The Completion of “Zero Download”: Real-Time Augmented Tools
In wearable environments, searching for and installing apps disrupts the flow of interaction.
LeeDo’s role is to ensure that the right application appears and disappears instantly where one’s gaze rests or one’s gesture reaches.



2) The Realization of “Digital Ooga-Booga”: Tooling the Body’s Language
Gestures and eye-tracking are humanity’s most primitive and intuitive languages.

Within LeeDo, bodily movements become vibe-coding commands—
a single hand motion creates a new tool,
a glance pulls another’s idea into one’s field of view.

3) Spatial Public Sphere: The World as a Canvas
The public sphere is no longer confined to rectangular screens.
In the wearable era, LeeDo transforms physical space itself into a public sphere—
with living applications floating on walls, tables, and between people.
Communication transcends words, achieving synchronized experience beyond borders and languages.








9. Personal Philosophy Embedded in LeeDo
The Unification of Complexity

LeeDo’s structure draws inspiration from linear independence in linear algebra
and the beauty of its equivalent properties.
Just as numerous complex theorems ultimately converge into a single essence,
LeeDo re-generates all human imagination through a matrix of “living language.”

Ultimately, LeeDo is a new vector space formed by the basis known as Hyunwoo Yoon.

Within this space, all human ideas exist independently,
yet through LeeDo’s combination, they generate infinite-dimensional possibilities.




Declaration
2026.01.05
LeeDo Manifesto






The author of this manifesto is Hyunwoo Yoon.
However, in faithful alignment with LeeDo’s philosophy,
this document was crafted using AI as an active tool.
This stands as the first proof of LeeDo’s identity—
a living testament that even LeeDo’s very emergence into the world
was born through collaboration between human will and AI intelligence.
Through this, LeeDo moves beyond abstraction
and begins to exist as a tangible reality.
